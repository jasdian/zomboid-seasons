# Work — Full-Cycle Team Dispatch

End-to-end: clarify → research → plan → execute → verify → review → finalize.

> $ARGUMENTS

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **ASK QUESTIONS** — Use `AskUserQuestion` when scope, approach, or priorities are unclear. Clarify FIRST, act SECOND.
2. **USE TASKS** — Track phases via `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`. This maintains rhythm and shows progress.
3. **DISPATCH AGENTS** — Hard implementation goes to `architect` agent (opus). Verification goes to `/test` skill. Review goes to `/review` skill.
4. **LOOP UNTIL DONE** — After each phase, check results and fix issues before moving on. Max 3 fix attempts per failure before asking the user.

## PHASE 0: Initialize

### 0.1 Parse Request

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **What**: Feature, fix, refactor, optimization?
- **Where**: Which modules/files?
- **Why**: What problem does this solve?

### 0.2 Create Task List

**MANDATORY**: Set up tracking:

```
TaskCreate: "Clarify requirements"
TaskCreate: "Research codebase"
TaskCreate: "Plan implementation"
TaskCreate: "Execute tasks"
TaskCreate: "Final verification"
```

---

## PHASE 1: CLARIFY

Mark "Clarify requirements" as `in_progress`.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is clear and unambiguous, proceed directly. Otherwise:

Use `AskUserQuestion` to clarify:
- **Scope**: Which modules/files does this affect?
- **Approach**: Preferred approach if multiple options exist?
- **Priority**: Correctness first, minimal changes, or full refactor?

**DO NOT PROCEED until you know:**
- [ ] What exactly to build/fix
- [ ] Which parts of the codebase are affected
- [ ] Constraints and priorities

Mark task COMPLETE.

---

## PHASE 2: RESEARCH

Mark "Research codebase" as `in_progress`.

### 2.1 Codebase Research (Parallel Agents)

Launch Explore agents in parallel:

```
Agent(subagent_type: "Explore", prompt: "Find all code related to {topic}...", run_in_background: true)
Agent(subagent_type: "Explore", prompt: "Find callers/dependents of {module}...", run_in_background: true)
```

### 2.2 External Research

If the request involves external APIs, protocols, or unfamiliar concepts:
```
WebSearch: "{concept} Rust implementation"
```

### 2.3 Synthesize

Collect results. Build understanding of:
- What code exists and how it's structured
- What needs to change
- What constraints exist

### 2.4 Research-Informed Questions

If research reveals options or ambiguities not covered in Phase 1:
```
AskUserQuestion: "I found that {module} uses {pattern}. Should we:
  A) Keep existing pattern and extend it
  B) Refactor to {better pattern} (affects N files)
  C) Something else"
```

Mark task COMPLETE.

---

## PHASE 3: PLAN

Mark "Plan implementation" as `in_progress`.

### 3.1 Decompose into Tasks

For each task, define:
- **Title**: What to do
- **Files**: Which files to modify/create
- **Difficulty**: STANDARD or HARD
- **Dependencies**: Which tasks must complete first
- **Success criteria**: How to verify it works

### 3.2 Difficulty Classification

| Difficulty | Handler | When |
|-----------|---------|------|
| STANDARD | Main session (you) | Single-file changes, config updates, straightforward additions |
| HARD | `architect` agent (opus) | Cross-module refactors, complex types/lifetimes, tricky bugs, API redesigns |

### 3.3 Present Plan

Show the user:
- Task list with difficulty and file scope
- Execution order
- Any risks or trade-offs

**MANDATORY**: Wait for user approval before executing.

```
AskUserQuestion: "Plan has {N} tasks ({X} standard, {Y} hard). Ready to execute?"
  A) "Execute as-is"
  B) "Adjust plan first"
  C) "Show more detail"
  D) "Abort"
```

Mark task COMPLETE.

---

## PHASE 4: EXECUTE

Mark "Execute tasks" as `in_progress`.

### 4.1 Create Per-Task Tracking

```
TaskCreate per plan task: "{task_id}: {title}"
```

### 4.2 Execute Each Task

For each task in dependency order:

#### Step 1: IMPLEMENT

**STANDARD tasks** — implement directly in the main session.

**HARD tasks** — delegate to architect agent:
```
Agent(
  subagent_type: "architect",
  description: "{task title}",
  prompt: "
    Task: {description}
    Files: {file list}
    Success criteria: {criteria}
    Context: {relevant findings from Phase 2}

    Read CLAUDE.md for project conventions.
    Implement the minimal change that solves this correctly.
    Verify your work with cargo check/clippy/test before reporting back.
  "
)
```

#### Step 2: VERIFY — `/test`

After implementation, run verification:
```
Skill(skill: "test")
```

**If FAIL**: Fix the issue and re-verify. Max 3 attempts.
- Attempt 1-2: Fix directly (STANDARD) or re-dispatch architect (HARD)
- Attempt 3: Ask user for guidance

#### Step 3: REVIEW — `/review`

After tests pass:
```
Skill(skill: "review")
```

**Handle findings:**
- **Critical**: Fix immediately, re-run `/test`
- **Warning**: Note for user, continue unless it's a security issue
- **Suggestion**: Note for user, continue

### 4.3 Parallel Execution

Independent tasks (no shared files) can run in parallel:
```
Agent(subagent_type: "architect", prompt: "Task A...", run_in_background: true)
Agent(subagent_type: "architect", prompt: "Task B...", run_in_background: true)
```

After both complete, run `/test` once for all changes.

### 4.4 Error Recovery

| Error | Recovery |
|-------|----------|
| Compile error | Fix directly or re-dispatch architect |
| Test failure | Analyze failure, fix, re-verify |
| Architect agent stuck | Try different approach or ask user |
| Unfamiliar error | WebSearch for solution |

After 3 failed fix attempts on any task, escalate:
```
AskUserQuestion: "Task {id} failed verification 3 times. Last error: {error}. How to proceed?"
  A) "Let me look at it"
  B) "Skip this task"
  C) "Try different approach: {describe}"
  D) "Abort"
```

Mark task COMPLETE when all tasks done.

---

## PHASE 5: FINALIZE

Mark "Final verification" as `in_progress`.

### 5.1 Final Verification

Run `/test` one final time to confirm everything passes together.

### 5.2 Summary

Output:

```
---

**Work complete.**

**Goal**: {from $ARGUMENTS}

**Tasks**: {completed}/{total}
**Files modified**: {list with 1-line description each}
**Tests**: PASS / FAIL
**Review**: {clean / N findings noted}

**Key decisions**:
- {decision 1}
- {decision 2}

**Risks / TODOs**:
- {any remaining items}

---
```

### 5.3 Commit

```
AskUserQuestion: "Ready to commit these changes?"
  A) "Yes — commit"
  B) "Let me review first"
  C) "Make adjustments: {describe}"
```

- **Commit**: Create a commit with a descriptive message
- **Review**: Wait for user
- **Adjustments**: Loop back to Phase 4 for the specific changes

Mark task COMPLETE.

---

## Loop Control: When to Return to User

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Scope unclear | AskUserQuestion |
| Research reveals options | Present options |
| Plan ready | Get approval before executing |
| Task BLOCKED | Surface blocker |
| 3× fix failures | Escalate to user |
| All tasks done | Present summary |

**NEVER silently:**
- Skip a phase
- Make architectural decisions without presenting the plan
- Continue past repeated failures without reporting
- Commit without asking
